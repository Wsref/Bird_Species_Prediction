### Machine Learning
### We will use random forests to predict a bird's species.
### We will use the Caltech-UC San Diego dataset, which contains about 12,000 photos of birds from 200 different species.
#### Here we are not going to look at the pictures because that would need a convolutional neural network (CNN). Instead, we will be using attributes of the birds such as size, shape, and color.
